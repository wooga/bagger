# bagger

A framework agnostic packaging solution to speed up client side
rendering by using the following techniques:

* Generating versioned assets to maximize cache efficiency
* Combine, minify and lint javascript and css files to reduce bandwidth
* Zip assets to further reduce bandwidth consumption
* Generating a file manifest to lookup an asset's location
* Rewrite urls in css files with the versioned file name
* Bundle up the assets as a zip file
